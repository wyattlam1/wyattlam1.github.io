Yes, I’m sure there are thousands of the same “cheezy” topics out there,  but I came across my own personal view a few days ago and I’d like to share it with you.

A late night chat with a few friends sparked this thought.  We were discussing how to be successful, how to make more money, and how to grow in our careers.  The conversation trailed off, deviating from topic to topic.  I didn’t think too much of our discussion at that time, but I took some of those thoughts back home with me and mulled it overnight.

Over the course of a few days, I consolidated my thoughts and I came across a realization regarding being successful.  It has touched me deeply and I have definitely taken it to heart.  So what are the 3 ingredients for success?  

1.  Love what you do.
2.  Spend time on what you do.
3.  Be great at what you do.

1, 2 and 3, in that order.  Here’s my logic.  Ultimately, I concluded that in order to be successful, you must be great – not good, great – at what you do.  Well duh, thanks for stating the obvious, right?  So I broke it down further.  How do you get to be great at something?  You have to spend time with it.  Practicing, learning, growing.  No one ends up to be a star overnight.  You have to work at it.  Now spending abundant amount of time in certain tasks easily ends up boring.  The journey is always difficult and often times there are a lot of reasons to give up.  Thus it leads me to my last point.  Love what you do.  If you enjoy every moment you spend time with your activity, you will naturally be focused on your goal and driven to accomplish being the best at it.  

1.  Love what you do.
2.  Spend time on what you do.
3.  Be great at what you do.
