Form a vision, then build the team. Not the other way around.

A team without a vision is not a team.  It is a group of individuals pursuing their own objectives.  Some of these objectives may overlap, but the group ends up pulled in multiple directions.

A vision aligns these individuals.  It focuses them around common goal.  It provides a cohesive direction to gather around and a solid foundation to build upon.  A vision helps build a team.

Form a vision, then build the team.
