Making career decisions is always a daunting task. Whether you are a student choosing a university or a professional choosing your next job, the decision notably impacts the next steps of your life.

To top all of that, if you are an analytic person like me, you must have experienced the endless struggle when faced with a difficult dilemma.  I usually start by weighing all the contending sides and end up lost among the countless possibilities.  For instance, I recently experienced this when branching out to a new team at work.  Team organization, technology stack, and development process were among my list of considerations, just to name a few.  Additionally, each team seemed to provide ample opportunities for career advancement and growth.  I was spinning in circles.

Thus, in hopes of resolving this, I seeked help from my supportive manager. He asked me this.

> ## Where do you want to be in five years?

I pondered over this for a short moment and subsequently told him I wanted to head towards management.  I enjoyed my previous experiences of leading my team’s development process as scrum master, and felt the natural progression would be towards management.  So I thought to myself,

> ## Management would entail qualities such as technical expertise, organizational skills, and interpersonal communication.
>
>
> ## Most of all, a management position epitomizes leadership.

Leadership. That’s the quality of a great manager and that’s what I needed to focus on.

As I realized this, it became clear to me which factors were most important for me to priortize around my team decision.  While qualities such as team foundation and development technologies were important, leadership opportunities were essential for me to achieve my five year goal.

So, next time you are faced with a difficult career decision, where do you want to be in five years?
