My family and I visited Hong Kong early January 2016.  Among all the cities I've visited, I've never seen one as dense as Hong Kong. The number of people bustling around the towering skyscrapers was truly astonishing.  We spent a total of 5 days exploring this beautiful city.

### We went up to the International Finance Centre (IFC) to get a higher vantage point of the city.  Look at the density of those buildings.  Staring at them makes me a little dizzy.

On the third day, we visited the small island of Cheung Chau (é•·æ´²) southwest of Hong Kong which housed a quaint little fishing village.  It was a sunny day, making it a perfect day away from the crowded city.

We returned to Hong Kong in the late afternoon to head up to Victoria Peak.  Of course, a trip to Hong Kong isn't complete without the grand view from the peak.
