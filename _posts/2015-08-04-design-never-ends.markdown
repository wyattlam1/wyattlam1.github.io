This is the fifth iteration of my personal website. I can't believe I purchased the wyattlam.com domain six years ago and launched my first site soon after. I knew almost nothing about web design then (still have minimal knowledge now) but *wow* it was interesting to look back at my previous designs.

<br>

<div>
    <div class="row">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_1.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="One of the first designs for my personal site.">
            <img src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_1.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">One of the first designs for my personal site.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="float: right">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_2.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Iterated on the earlier design.">
            <img src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_2.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Iterated on the earlier design.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

I clearly remember the point at which I decided to completely reboot each iteration. There usually was one primary reason that made me want to redesign the site, but sometimes it was just to keep it up to date. You see, design never ends. There's always some aspect you can improve on - updating some visual UI, shifting content around to improve overall flow, or making room for newer content. That's what I love about design. It's forever ongoing, constantly growing to adapt to new requirements.

<div>
    <div class="row">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_3.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Large redesign with new content.">
            <img class="bordered" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_3.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Large redesign with new content.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="float: right">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_4.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Simplified and set blog to appear first.">
            <img class="bordered" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_4.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Simplified and set blog to appear first.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

Well, here's the 6th iteration of my website. I plan on keeping this one *up-to-date*, but come to think of it, I said the same thing each time in the past...
