This is the sixth iteration of my personal website. I can't believe I purchased the wyattlam.com domain six years ago and launched my first site soon after. I knew almost nothing about web design then (probably still have minimal knowledge now) but *wow* it was interesting to look back at my previous designs.

<div class="section-spacer"></div>

<div>
    <div class="row">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_1.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="One of the first designs for my personal site.">
            <img style="width: 100%" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_1.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">One of the first designs for my personal site.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="float: right">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_2.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Another iteration on the earlier design.">
            <img style="width: 100%" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_2.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Another iteration on the earlier design.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section-spacer"></div>

I clearly remember the point at which I decided to completely reboot each iteration. There usually was one primary reason that made me want to redesign the site, but sometimes it was just to keep it up to date. You see, design never ends. There's always some aspect you can improve on - updating some visual UI, shifting content around to improve overall flow, or making room for newer content. That's what I love about design. It's forever ongoing, constantly growing to adapt to new requirements.

<div>
    <div class="row">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_3.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Large redesign with new content.">
            <img style="width: 100%" class="bordered" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_3.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Large redesign with new content.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="float: right">
        <a href="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_4.jpg" data-lightbox="site" data-title="Simplified and moved blog to be primary content.">
            <img style="width: 100%" class="bordered" src="{{ site.images }}/design_never_ends_site_4.jpg" />
            <span class="img-caption">Simplified and moved blog to be primary content.</span>
        </a>
    </div>
</div>

Well, here's the sixth iteration of my website. I plan on keeping this one *up-to-date*, but come to think of it, I said the same thing each time in the past...
