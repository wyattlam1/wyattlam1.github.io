[How Instagram Co-founder Mike Krieger Took Its Engineering Org from 0 to 300 People](http://firstround.com/review/how-instagram-co-founder-mike-krieger-took-its-engineering-org-from-0-to-300-people/){:target="_blank"}

Early in my career, I struggled with the idea of being a *generalist* vs a *specialist* engineer.  Many of the senior engineers I interacted with seemed to specialize in a specific tech stack, giving me the perception that specializing is the *only* way to advance  your career.

However, a mentor eventually told me:

> "You need to dribble **and** shoot.  Nobody wants someone who can **only** dribble on their team."

And that stuck.

Reading about how Mike prioritized flexibility and diversity as key qualities when he cultivated the engineering org at Instagram helped reinforce that notion.  

I'm also able to experience it firsthand, now that I'm also working at Instagram ðŸ˜Š
