Since departing from the beautiful city of Seattle, I have received numerous questions regarding sights and activities when visiting Seattle. I would rack my brain each time to haphazardly concoct a lengthy list of all my favorite point of interests, activities, and eateries, only to forget about it the next time someone asked. Well, I’ve finally decided to jot down the list so I have one place to reference all my favorite places around Seattle.

# **Points of Interest**

**Kerry Park:** Kerry Park offers the best skyline view of Seattle. A scenic overlook to swing by after dinner and wind down for the night. 

**[Space Needle](http://www.spaceneedle.com){:target="_blank"}:** This should’t need an introduction. Definitely worth the $14 to climb above the towering sky scrapers. Go up at dusk to watch the entire city illuminate right in front of you.

**[Seattle Center](http://www.seattlecenter.com){:target="_blank"}:** After the Space Needle, wander around Seattle Center and browse the art and museums. Visit their website beforehand to check if they have any ongoing events!

**[Pike Place Market](http://pikeplacemarket.org){:target="_blank"}:** A bustling farmers market where artists, merchants, farmers, fisherman, florists, all setup shop. Meander through the unique shops and browse the myriad of hand-made crafts, fresh seafood, flowers, or tasty treats to your heart’s content. Pike Place also houses the first ever Starbucks coffee shop.

**Gas Works Park:** Escape the narrow streets of downtown across Lake Union and take a stroll through Gas Works Park on a sunny afternoon. A former coal gasification plant turned into a public park, Gas Works overlooks Lake Union and provides a beautiful skyline view of downtown.

**[Fremont Sunday Market](http://www.fremontmarket.com){:target="_blank"}:** If you liked Pike Place and are available on a Sunday, check out this quirky flea market for vintage jewelry, crafts, and other miscellaneous items. They also have several local food trucks that are great for lunch!

**Ballard Locks (Hiram H. Chittenden Locks):** The Ballard Locks are boat locks between Lake Union to Puget Sound, an intriguing structure if you haven’t seen one before. The lock allows boats to traverse through a waterway where the water levels can be raised higher or lower. Oh, and check out the fish ladder!

**[Olympic Sculpture Park](http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/olympic-sculpture-park){:target="_blank"}:** Take an walk through Seattle Art Museum’s Olympic Sculpture Park. It’s an outdoor park with beautiful views of Puget Sound and Seattle’s waterfront. It’s free and open to the public!
