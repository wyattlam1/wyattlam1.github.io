I flew out to Chicago to visit Diana for a week in mid February. Braving the frigid cold, we headed out for the day to stroll around downtown Chicago. The 2 degree temperature was actually bearable. It was only the wind chill that made it feel like little daggers stabbing into your face. I couldn’t decide if I preferred this sunny, freezing Chicago to the cloudy, slightly warmer Seattle winter.

After strolling around for the day. We decided to wind down for the night with a visit to the John Hancock Signature Room Lounge. It was an awesome view. Unfortunately I didn’t have a tripod with me, so my hand-held skills were put to the test.
