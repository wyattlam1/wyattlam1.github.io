One of the hardest things I struggled with in my transition from a tech lead to an engineering manager is stepping away from personally driving projects to supporting others to do so in my stead. It was challenging to let the people I supported independently drive the project while still ensuring it was completed correctly and on time.

I learned this framework that I’ve found extremely useful and I still conciously revisit this periodically, especially when I find myself in a similar situation. 

> 1. Align on the end goal(s)
> 2. Set clear expectations
> 3. Provide continuous feedback



Easy to say. Hard to do.
