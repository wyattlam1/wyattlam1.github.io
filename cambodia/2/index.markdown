We spent the second day meandering through the beautiful temples of Angkor Wat. The detailed carvings on the structure walls and expansive size of the temples were surreal.

### The temple was divided into three sections: Heaven (top), Earth (middle), and Hell (bottom).  We were standing in Hell in the photo above.

After spending half the day in Angkor Wat, we proceeded to visit the infamous Ta Prohm (The Tomb Raider Temple).  Built by King Jayavarman VII, this temple was dedicated to his mother.

### Most of the temple is still standing only because of the the trees.  Their snake-like roots keep the stones pieced together.

The last stop of the day was the grand city of Angkor Thom.  Angkor Wat was already quite expansive in size, but Angkor Thom completely shadowed it.
