On the third day, we backtracked and visited the last few temples we skipped previously.

After visiting the Terrace of Elephants, we arrived at the Preah Khan Temple.  While Ta Prohm was dedicated to the king's mother, Preah Khan was dedicated to his father.

Our last stop of the day was a temple outside of the central Angkor Wat area.  This temple was unique because, unlike the other temples, it was built mostly in red sandstone. Despite its small size, it was probably the most intricate temple we saw.
